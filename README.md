In this blog, we will discuss & learn about the GSAP fullscreen slider animation libraries. You’re not limited to “one-after-the-other” sequencing; have animations overlap as much as you want. Nest timelines inside other timelines. Insert gaps, callbacks, labels, staggered tweens, and more. You get precise control over timing and unprecedented flexibility to create expressive animations with minimal code.
